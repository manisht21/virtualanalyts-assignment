# Digit Recognition using Classical Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset in CSV format.

The following classical machine learning models are used:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (implemented from scratch)
- Support Vector Machine (Linear SVM)
- Decision Tree

The workflow includes data loading, normalization, visualization of digit images, model training, and evaluation using accuracy scores and confusion matrices. Misclassified samples are also visualized to analyze model errors.

An ensemble voting method combining the three models is also implemented to study robustness and stability.

No neural networks, deep learning, or pre-trained models are used in this project, in accordance with the assignment requirements.
